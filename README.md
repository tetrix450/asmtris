# asmtris
Basic and crude x86 assembly implementation of tetris for DOS.

# Known problems
Comments in code and procedure names are in spanish, and they were meant to be seen only by me at first, so I will look forward to make this code more universal and more understandable in the near future. Currently the game only counts the number of completed lines, so there is no scoring system besides that and the color of the moving pieces is hardcoded to red. Placed pieces are blue.

# Controls
You can use the left and right arrow keys to move the pieces and "Z" and "X" to rotate them clockwise or counter-clockwise.
The down arrow key is for the soft drop, and you can also hard drop using the up arrow key.
To pause or unpause the game, press enter.
